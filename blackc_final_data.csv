The tool should facilitate seamless interaction, enabling users to gain valuable insights without the need for technical expertise. Key functionalities should include data exploration, trend identification, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection, all presented in a comprehensible format. The tool must also ensure efficient handling of CSV datasets while maintaining accuracy and reliability in its analyses. CSV data is acquired from a source (local file system, cloud storage, etc.). The data is then converted into a pandas DataFrame using the read_csv() function or similar methods provided by the pandas library. Data Cleaning operations are performed on the dataframe so that it serves as an ideal input for Pandas Agent. These may include: Column Data type conversion. Handling Duplicates Handling unnecessary columns, etc. Langchain’s Pandas Agent is initialized with the necessary parameters. These parameters include: System prompt: A custom prompt provided by the user or defined in the application. Temperature: A parameter controlling the randomness of the model’s outputs. Model: The specific model or model configuration to be used by the agent. Other relevant parameters based on the requirements and capabilities of the agent. The DataFrame created in the previous step serves as input for the Pandas Agent. It contains the structured data which will serve as input for the Pandas Agent. The user interacts with the system by posing queries in natural language. Langchain’s Pandas Agent interprets these queries using GPT-4 backend and converts them into executable commands or operations on the DataFrame. The Pandas Agent executes the operations needed on the DataFrame. These operations may include: Filtering: Selecting rows or columns based on specified criteria. Aggregation: Computing summary statistics or aggregating data based on groups. Transformation: Modifying data in the DataFrame (e.g., adding or removing columns, changing data types). Joining/Merging: Combining multiple DataFrames based on common keys or indices. Sorting: Arranging rows or columns in a specified order. Other pandas DataFrame operations as required by the user queries. The processed output is delivered to the end user through thestreamlituser interface. The user can review the insights provided by the system and further refine their queries if needed. Data Analysis Tool with Streamlit frontend. To make the tool follow the Indian standards in terms of Financial Year Quarters, currency and human readable values instead of exponential values. The challenge was solved by decreasing the temperature of Pandas agent to 0 and make a custom system prompt to introduce maximum bias approximating the desirable answers. The user was able get data analysis insights without expertise in python, pandas and other tools used in the process of Data Analysis in a fraction of time compared to what it would have been if the process was done manually.

Furthermore, data management must be very precise, cost-effective, and completed as soon as possible. The inability to handle data can result in costly consequences and a permanent stain on the company’s image. Every company is responsible for developing a robust data management plan. The following are some of the reasons why data management is critical to the success of the firm. Instant Availability of Information: Data management makes information easily available for quick access based on company needs. Data management is also essential for accounting procedures like auditing and other strategy-based operations like company planning. The more time you spend hunting for misplaced files and missing documents, the less productive you will be. And you are aware that time is money. Keeping all of your documents structured might therefore assist to make procedures run more smoothly and quickly. Compliance: The government passed legislation requiring businesses to maintain these data. There are also periodical checks to verify that there is no manipulation. Furthermore, if a corporation is involved in a dispute, they must maintain these records for years until a solid verdict on the matter is reached. Faster Transitions to New Technology: Because technology trends change so quickly, organizations must embrace whatever comes their way. Losing information due to obsolete or outdated systems is the last thing you want for your company. Every piece of data preserved in the firm records is essential for everyday operations, managing multiple divisions, completing computations, audits, and so on. Make Right Business Decisions: Businesses use a variety of information sources for company planning, trend research, and performance management. To execute the same activity, different departments’ teams employ different sources of information. Because the legitimacy and precision of information are highly dependent on the source, analyzing several sources may have a detrimental influence on the organization. Robust data management prevents this from happening.

bctech2037,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/realtime-kibana-dashboard-for-a-financial-tech-firm/,"Client:A leading fintech firm in the USA Industry Type:Finance Services:Financial services Organization Size:100+ Create a real-time Kibana dashboard to monitor the real-time movement and activities related to company/stock on the AWS to analyse data and get insights through dashboards to prevent due diligence. Dashboard should include visualizations of sentiments, FOIA requests, stock prices, volume, borrow rate, etc. Create real-time dashboards to get insights about the data and to analyse the relative change in different activities. Someone filing FOIA SEC request or FOIA FDA request and/or registering for conference calls might also have posted some negative tweets on tweeter to influence the market. Dashboard should display data of requests, sentiments, stock prices, etc on the same timeline, so that we will be able to observe the changes and relative changes with respect to time. Make separate dashboard for 2 stock symbols to analyse the activities and changes specific to that and a dashboard for all the data, eg. stocks, requests, etc. Change in sentiments effecting the price of the stock, borrow rate, trading volume, etc. should be noticeable. There is a list of names, make alert on the dashboard when the requests are filed by them on the same timeline used for other data. Also include the candlestick chart to view the stock details like open, close, high, low, volume with respect to time. For FOIA SEC and FDA requests, made a metric chart representing the total number of requests and requesters, created a date histogram to view the frequency of requests and requesters with respect to time, bar chart to view the top requester name, organization, category, pie chart to view the proportion of final disposition of requests and tag cloud for the description of the requests for the entries present in the selected time range and a search table that contains the selected columns (only relevant ones) for both SEC filings and FDA filings. Similarly, for citation data, created a date histogram to view the frequency of citations and names of firms who posted with respect to time and bar chart to view number of citations by firm in the selected time range and a search table that contains the selected columns (only relevant ones). Index containing fail to deliver data is used to plot the date histogram in which volume failed is represented by the bar along the line representing the price at that time, bar chart where bars represents the total volume failed to deliver with respect to stock symbol and average price of the stock symbol in the selected time range by a dot size add on and tag cloud of the stock symbol as per fail to delivers. For twitter data (short seller’s data), made a pie chart to show the proportion of polarity, metric table to show the highest 10 average retweets with respect to user name, made a date histogram to show the frequency of tweets as per time and another date histogram representing the amount of positive and negative sentiments with the help of bars as per time to leverage us to observe if change in amount of sentiments is affecting price of stock, volume in trade and fail to deliver, etc., bar chart to show the total posts and number of posts in the selected time range and another bar chart to show the count of followers and friends in the index in selected time range. A search table is made with columns like polarity, follower counts, retweets and post with timestamp to get precise info of what we have in visualizations. For the list of names to be tracked on requests made and to make alert for them, added a annotation on the TSVB graph and added all of these along with the above visualizations on the dashboard on Kibana to make it a real-time dashboard and we can use this dashboard to do relative analysis. For the dedicated dashboards to the stock, created and added following visualizations: 3 dashboards- 1 dashboard for complete data and 2 dashboards dedicatedly for one stock each. Kibana and Elasticsearch Visualizations and analytical skills were used Following databases are used to: AWS Management Console As I was using Kibana and studying the stock data for the first time, I faced challenges in making complex visualizations and understanding the terms related to stock data. Using filters while making Vega Charts to make candlestick chart with inconsistent data was displeasing. Challenges related to the creation of complex visualization was solved exploring options on the Kibana and getting reference from the online sources. In order to understand the stock information and how things work, I got immense amount of knowledge from the client and from my project manager. For filtering of data in Vega charts I took help from the online sources.

The solution is an effort to create the missing data by the existing data as we came to know that the‘key’data can be created by involving some deep methodologies and vast logical aspects linked to it. The incoming data from shiphero company is timestamp data therefore using this sequential data we can create the missing data we need to get the required KPI’s. The overall architecture included getting data from shiphero through api doing some preprocessing and creating our‘key’through this data and populating it on Google big query. This google big query is linked to Google data studio for insights visualisation. The data coming from Shiphero is extracted every day using a cron job scheduler. Google app engine service is used to preprocess and apply a transformation to the data. Ready-to-use Google data studio Dashboard. Google app engine service-based scheduler code. Initially the approach client introduced that could be able to solve the problem directly failed to give proper results and because of that we need to come up with a solution that could be able to estimate our ‘key’ column to some extent.With the way around solution using statistics and data modelling there were a series of challenges coming that were creating a question mark for us but with keen solution building and delivering the desired results we came to solution for every challenge that arose. Statistics was the only way around for the challenges we faced because it was the data which was missing and as the incoming data was in sequential format so we were able to figure out the patterns from that and the main problem of missing data for our KPI’s Better insights into the business.

For eg: we have Person nodes in the data, now people might enter their names in different ways. Our main aim is to identify Person nodes that may have similar data and are actually the same person. This will be represented as a perfect match between the nodes. This single-person view is referred to as the Golden Record Till date, we have loaded data into Neo4j and created relationships with score property which defines match strength. We have created some criterias by which we can determine what constitutes two nodes being the same and then based on them created ‘perfect match’ and ‘probable match’.We have considered four properties for our criteria – full name, address, driver’s license, and passport number. We have relationships between nodes for these properties with scores, we use these in our perfect match and probable match creation. We have also configured Graphlytics (a viz software) in the virtual machine which connects to the neo4j database and helps vizualize the nodes and relationships. We have also worked on some algorithms using the GDS library in neo4j to produce more information on the graph, the common neighbors algorithm was used to produce scores based on node similarity and the higher the score the higher the similarity. Other algorithms were tried as well but since all the properties are of String format it did not work on it.

We have created the homepage for this application. We have changed the code structure of the front end to make it more fast and efficient. Solution Architecture An application, where the first automated top asset pair selection happens. If the coins are co-integrated, then only one indicator must be executed else trading starts based on 2 indicators. The AI agent will take specific action to trade based on the algorithm. Deliverables We have removed the old API and integrated the new api with the application. We have altered the code structure of the front end to make the code faster and more efficient. Tools used Visual studio code Language/techniques used Python Skills used Django Databases used SQlite Web Cloud Servers used Digital Ocean What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution We faced an issue while integrating coin api with the application while retrieving the data. To retrieve the data using the coin api, we need to input a symbol id. This symbol id is a combination of exchange_name, symbol_type, currency_we_want_to_trade, and quote_currency. There are N coins that can be retrieved using coin api. There are more than multiple exchanges, multiple symbol types, and multiple quote currencies for ONE SINGLE COIN. This makes there is a huge no. Of combinations for one single coin. This made the execution of the api integration very slow. How the Technical Challenges were Solved We created one drop-down for exchange selection, one drop-down for symbol type selection, one drop for coin, and one drop-down for quote currency selection. The user selects these, and in the backend, a combination is created and is sent as input to the coin api code and the data is retrieved without slowing down the process.

The client’s ads were spread across multiple revenue generating platforms, including Google Adsense, Adx, and Ezoic, while the spending was managed through the Google Ads Platform. At that time, the client lacked a centralized dashboard or website that could effectively calculate ROAS by integrating revenue and cost streams. This fragmentation made it challenging for the client to track and evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. Therefore, a comprehensive solution was developed and implemented, providing a centralized platform for calculating ROAS, aligning revenue and cost data from various sources, and enabling informed decision-making regarding advertising investments. We developed a comprehensive solution to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) and centralizing their advertising data. The solution involved collecting data from four different APIs: Google Ads API for spending data, Google Adsense API, Ad Manager API, and Ezoic data for revenue data. To ensure compatibility, we utilized an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool to convert the data received from each API, which was in different formats, into a standardized format storing them Pandas Dataframe for both revenue and spending data. The transformed data was then stored in a Postgres database for easy access and management. To automate the data extraction process, we implemented an ETL script that runs twice daily via cronjob on a Digital Ocean VM, ensuring the latest data is always available. Moreover, we designed a backend API using the Flask framework. This API fetched the required data from the Postgres DB, allowing users to retrieve relevant information efficiently. Finally, we implemented a ROAS Dashboard frontend to display the calculated ROAS using the fetched values. The dashboard provided a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to track and monitor their advertising performance. With our solution in place, the client could now easily monitor ROAS over time, access consolidated data, and make informed decisions regarding their advertising investments. The solution architecture involved a multi-step process to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating ROAS and centralizing their advertising data. Data was collected from various APIs, including Google Ads API, Google Adsense API, Ad Manager API, and Ezoic data, and transformed into a standardized format using an ETL tool. The transformed data was stored in a Postgres database, and a backend API was developed using the Flask framework to fetch the required data. The calculated ROAS was then displayed on a Next Js Dashboard, providing users with an intuitive interface to track and analyze their advertising performance. Python 3.9 Flask API DigitalOcean Droplet Functional Programming in Python ETL Tool Python Git Deployment Data Engineering Web Development using Next js We usedPostgreSQLdatabase for the project. Digital Ocean Droplet Some of the technical challenges encountered were: 1. Ensuring data integrity: Implemented checks, cleansing, and validation to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data. 2. Docker image deployment on VM: Configured VM to support Docker Image for ETL and deployed the image for seamless execution. 3. Setting up automated ETL pipeline: Automated data extraction, transformation, and loading processes for efficient data management via cronjob. 4. Adding SSL certificate to backend API: Secured backend API with SSL certificate, enabling encrypted communication for enhanced data protection. The implemented solution had a significant positive impact on the client’s business.

The importance of digital analytics is that it allows for a data-driven approach to marketing, and as such it can produce better results. The primary objective of the project is to help the businesses in knowing their target audience, understanding the trends in digital marketing, and providing insights on the analytics part of their website performance. Use the digital analytical data to determine if your business’ aims are in line with the customer’s wants and needs. As the picture of the customer’s needs unfolds, adjust the objectives accordingly. The main aim of this project is to assist the businesses to improve their website performance with the use of technologies like Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and dashboards built on Whatagraph. Google Analytics: Google Analytics is integral to tracking and measuring data from a number of digital platforms, but especially web metrics and customer behaviour. For example, through Google Analytics, you can see when people drop out of the buying process, perhaps they abandon while on the cart page, which would then inform your decisions on how to improve the check-out process. Because Google Analytics measures traffic from a variety of devices and sources and integrates with other online platforms, such as Google Ads, it is a handy tool to get an overview of your business’s digital analytics. Google Tag Manager: Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments collectively known as tags on your website or mobile app. Once the small segment of Tag Manager code has been added to your project, you can safely and easily deploy analytics and measurement tag configurations from a web-based user interface. When Tag Manager is installed, your website or app will be able to communicate with the Tag Manager servers. You can then use Tag Manager’s web-based user interface to set up tags, establish triggers that cause your tag to fire when certain events occur, and create variables that can be used to simplify and automate your tag configurations.A Tag Manager container can replace all other manually-coded tags on a site or app, including tags from Google Ads, Google Analytics, Floodlight, and 3rd party tags. Whatagraph Dashboards: The whatgraph dashboards previews the important metrics related to the website including conversions, events, number of users and performance about ads and campaigns by the website. This dashboard helps in drawing some of the useful insights for the website notifying the strengths,gains and areas of improvement. Main deliverables for the project are: The main technical challenge faced was that any changes in Google Analytics are operational after 24 hrs. Thus, we can’t judge if the setup works as per required. We had to wait for 24 hours to check the setup. We could use real-time report as well to check the setup on-the spot. This analysis helps to improve website performance, understanding user behavior, understanding the impact of business campaigns and improvising the UI/UX to increase their potential users. Having insight into your clients’ behaviour and demographics can help you make decisions about serving them the right products at the right time for maximum chances of a sale. Such data could include a client’s persona, such as their age, location, and areas of interest. Some of the common metrics that are important in digital analytics include: Dashboard metrics: Some examples are pages per visit, bounce rate, and average duration of each visit. Most exited pages: Pages with an exit rate of 75–100% show that you need to examine the problem with the content and improve upon it. Most visited pages: These pages will make the customers either exit or explore the website further. Referring websites: These are other websites that link to your website. Conversion rate: This indicates whether the goal of your website was achieved, be it a sale of a product, a free giveaway, or a subscription to a newsletter. Frequency of visitors: This tells you about the loyalty of the customers. Days to the last transaction: This refers to the time lapse between the first visit and the sale. The shorter the time taken, the better it is for your business.

It had one main website and three other sub websites to analyse the button clicks, impressions and understanding the user’s behaviour on the website. Many events were to be tracked and converted to a dashboard in Google Data Studio to make it simpler to understand. This project was created to give this data in a way that companies can readily understand through the use of visualisations. The graphs will show the increase/decrease in any of the metrics, as well as the manner in which the increase/decrease occurs. It will display all of the crucial data monthly or even by date range to help you keep track of the changes that occur.

Google Data Studio Dashboards: The dashboards preview the important metrics related to the websites using graphs, tables to understand the trends, patterns in the users. The following steps were carried out for the project: The main deliverable for this project were dashboards on Google Data Studio depicting important metrics related to website performance. There were three sub websites for which there were two types of views each. Each of the views had several buttons related to the product. The project was about finding the user flow and event flow on the views. The main technical challenge faced was that there were multiple events setup in Google Analytics for one event and thus identifying a particular one was difficult. We had to communicate with the client to clarify about the event names. Although this took some time but it was necessary since accurateness of data is very essential for the project. This analysis helps to improve website performance, understanding user behavior, understanding the impact of business campaigns and improvising the UI/UX to increase their potential users.

We also need to decrease time probability based on the user’s past time range. We converted the user’s plugin data into binary values like 0 if the user hasn’t plugged-in his vehicle on that day and 1 if he plugged-in. We identified the driven distance based on the amount of charge used between two plug-in times. Then we trained the Ridge Regression ML model for identifying each day driven kilometer. From these kilometres we have identified the probability that user’s will plug-in today and it will increase day by day till the user does not plug-in his vehicle.

Advertisers who participate in Google Local Service Ads will receive a larger ad space with their competitor’s local services ads and they will be able to feature their local businesses throughout organic search queries. There are various aspects that firms must concentrate on in order to win the Google services ad and so raise their ranking. These enhancements may be implemented if companies obtain current data about their leads and analyse it in order to take appropriate actions in the future. This project was created to give this data in a way that companies can readily understand through the use of visualisations. The graphs will show the increase/decrease in any of the metrics, as well as the manner in which the increase/decrease occurs. It will display all of the crucial data monthly or even by date range to help you keep track of the changes that occur. The solution for the project includes data insights through visualisations which will help businesses to better analyse the available data. This solution will help the businesses in improvising the factors to increase their potential customers and raise their respective ranks. It is divided into two parts: databases and data dashboard. The databases will store the important data retrieved from the LSA dashboard and use them to calculate some important metrics. The data dashboard will represent those metrics in form of graphs and data in form of tables. The project deliverables can be divided into two parts: For extracting the data from the LSA Dashboard, we have made our own tool by python scripts. The automation tool will store data in the excel sheets and google bigquery for respective businesses on a day to day basis. PyCharm for compiling and running the code. JsonViewer for processing We have used the LSA API to extract data from the LSA Dashboard. Google Sheets API to store data in excel sheets. Bigquery API for storing data in google bigquery. The scripts for the automation tool were written in the Python programming language. Software Model: RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model In the RAD paradigm, less emphasis is placed on planning and more emphasis is placed on development activities. It aims to create software in a short period of time. Advantages of RAD Model: Two types of databases: Google excel sheets and google bigquery. Google BigQuery Cloud Database with up to 1 TB of free storage is being used. Some minor technical challenges were faced for clients with minimum data. For those, plotting graphs became difficult. We tried to process the data, remove the blank data spaces and plotted the graph with available data. It’s undeniable that Google’s Local Services ads (LSA) have changed the way home service businesses advertise online.

We came up with the appropriate models for various tasks and interpretations of how the data will be collected and analysed for the initial response, final response, retention, proficiency, and learning intent of the user. We designed the models in such a way that one can perform seamlessly grading for each question type (based on difficulty level) and at a different hierarchical level (sub-section, section, training, and so on). We knew that each user has its unique aptitude level (basic, intermediate, and advanced) and keeping that in my mind, we incorporated those aptitude levels in our analytics too. Moreover, we integrated the grade and time factor into the analysis so that more points are allotted for comparatively tough questions and quick responses, respectively.

The objective of this project is to collect data from a website given search and filter criteria. Data Brief: Filters: Contains a list of the federal states in Germany to Crawl: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany   We have developed a Python tool that crawls and scrapes all the apartment listings for all the states in Germany under each category namely: mieten wohnungen, kaufen wohnungen, kaufen anlageobjekte and kaufen grundstuck. The Scrapy library has been used to crawl and scrape. Beautiful soup could have also been used for the scraping purpose, but for the sake of consistency, Scrapy has been used for both purposes. Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival. Even though Scrapy was originally designed forweb scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs (such asAmazon Associates Web Services) or as a general purpose web crawler. Four Spiders have been created for each category to be scraped. Every spider crawls all the states in Germany and scrapes all the apartment listings for important data. Every spider creates a separate JSON file to store all its data. This data is then converted to CSV using another python script called “conversion”. The python tool has been completely automated and only needs the “Controller” script to be run. The script also has the capability of running every two weeks automatically.

bctech2153,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/population-and-community-survey-of-america/,"Client:A leading marketing firm in the USA Industry Type:Marketing services & Consulting Services:Marketing consultant Organization Size:100+ Project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ objective were to perform Data Abstraction, Data Structurization, Data Preprocessing, Data Cleaning, and Combining Data from all the years listed and finally presenting insights of the data by Exploratory Data Analysis. For Project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ task involved fetching json and unformatted csv data from numerous web links further needed to process data, handling nested JSON, data conversion of JSON data in dataframe, performing certain pandas operation for feature selection and structuring data. Concat all this data into one csv file then handle missing value by mapping with another dataset finally perform certain data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Module 1: Data Abstraction The process of data abstraction involves collecting data from numerous web links from Year 2005 to 2017 and viewing the data using JSON viewer in tree format. Module 2: Data Chunking and Integration Was unable to process data in pandas so performed data chunking with chunksize 10000 rows at a time for year 2005 likewise performed for all other years data till 2017 and finally combined all the dataframes into one containing all data from year 2005 to 2017. Module 3: Handling Complexity of Nested Data & format the Unformatted CSV Files Handling unformatted CSV in proper comma separated format so that data frame can be formed. Dataframe produced after merging for all the years from 2005 to 2017 contains a lot of nested JSON data among certain attributes so performed normalization of nested Json forming new_columns naming them based on their attributes key. 2.2.4 Module 4: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Involves handling missing value, contraction mapping with another dataset to fill the missing State_Zip_Code column, handling inf and -inf within the dataset for some attributes and forming a new column population_ratio based on passing formula among other attributes. 2.2.5 Module 5: Data Analysis This step involves forming a correlation matrix to understand the relation between numeric attributes. performed Exploratory Data Analysis on strong correlated attributes to understand pattern/relation between them. After completion of Project we provided: ● Jupyter Notebook ● Anaconda ● Notepad++ ● Sublime Text ● Brackets ● Python 3.4 ● JSON Viewer ● Python ● ETL Techniques ● Advanced Excel Formatting My project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ developed with a software model which makes the project high quality, reliable and cost effective. ● Software Model : RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model ● This Project follows a RAD Model as our model is not forming the loop from end to the start, also my project was based on prototyping without any specific planning. In the RAD model, there is less attention paid to the planning and more priority is given to the development tasks. It targets developing software in a short span of time. ● Advantages of RAD Model: o Changing requirements can be accommodated. o Progress can be measured. o Iteration time can be short with use of powerful RAD tools. o Productivity with fewer people in a short time. o Reduced development time. o Increases reusability of components. o Quick initial reviews occur. o Encourages customer feedback. o Integration from very beginning solves a lot of integration issues No Database is used in this project, only used Google Drive for Storing and Transferring Data. No Web Server is Used Data Cleaning and Filling out Missing Values by Data mapping with another dataset as the Data was not in proper format in the another dataset. Data Cleaning was done using a few built in pandas operations to deal with Missing Values, Ordering Data Columns, Data Formatting, Changing of data types and many more. Filling of remaining Missing Data from columns using Outer Join among the datasets and using Map Function of Python. Figure 1: Input Data Schema for Year 2008 Figure 2: Output Data Schema from Year 2005 to 2017 Figure 3: Dataset for Year 2008 figure 3 is pandas dataset of year 2008 which has 169595 rows and 25 columns which was fetched from authenticated survey web portal, data obtained were in JSON format which were converted into pandas dataframe likewise there are dataframes created from year 2005 to 2017. Figure 4:  Output Preprocessed Dataset figure 4 is an output preprocessed dataset from 2005 to 2017 which has 26,41,363 rows and 25 columns.

Structuring SQL Query to deal with all the database issues which were being used in BigQuery to solve those issues. ● Refresh token Expiration after 7 Days. Initially ‘Auth Playground’ was used for generating Refresh token which was getting expired after every 7 Days so to last it longer for more than a year we are now using the refresh token which was generated using Python script where proper token endpoints and many other headers were defined before generating the refresh token. ● Data Exception due to Inactive companies or not Updation of LSA Main sheet. Data Exception occurred while API data abstraction for few of the companies which were solved by adding more nested try and except statements after understanding issues also ‘LSA Clients Lead’ main sheet was not being updated by other members due to which we missed out data for few of the companies which were solved by creating script which will automatically update the mainsheet when an error occurred. ● Basecamp ProjectId Issue for transferring Data to multiple companies projects. This issue was solved by creating Basecamp Main sheet where data was fetched now by mapping the account id of fetched data using LSA Main sheet and project id of all the basecamp companies. ● Data Studio Time Series Plot data mismatch due to multiple account id. Solved by adding many parameters like setting the metrics which will do a summation of all the companies on a particular day for all the account id.

And from this pattern, we get some ranges that help us to give early warnings. We are more interested in non-survivor patients’ vital signs as compare to survivor patients. we find patterns invital signsthat could better determine that patient died (ex. if Sp02 is below 70, patient in 95% of cases died, if Sp02 is below 50%, the death rate is 99.9%) or we can take correlations which can help us to find better patterns to define death cases. Data The dataset which was used for analysis here is taken from the mimic website. But the dataset is not in the correct format which we want, after some manipulation, we get the data ready for the analysis. Approach I can’t go with 1st option because a major part of the data has missing values. so, I decided to go with the second option and fill missing values with the average of upper and lower values. But before that, I filtered the data and take only those patients’ data who died in a hospital or survive.
